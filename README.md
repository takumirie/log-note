# log-note
## simple way to logging with timestamp in command-line
## this program is now coding! so you shouldn't use this at this moment!

## Ruby version is now available!

This is my practice how to program with several languages.
So... I'm planning to release this program with PHP and Javascript(node).Moreover, Swift?

Please give me a advice! if you found my mistake.
